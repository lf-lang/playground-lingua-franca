/**
 * Reactor that subscribes to a specified MQTT topic on which
 * string messages are published. The timestamp of the output
 * will depend on the use_physical_time parameter and (if present)
 * the timestamp carried by the incoming message.
 * 
 * If `use_physical_time` is `tru`e (the default), then this reactor
 * uses the current physical time when the subscription notification
 * arrives, plus the `offset`, as the desired output timestamp.
 * If the incoming message is carrying a timestamp (the publisher
 * is an instance of `MQTTPublisher` with `include_timestamp` set
 * to `true), then this reactor measures the *apparent latency*
 * (the physical time of arrival minus the timestamp in the message).
 * At shutdown, this reactor will report that maximum and average
 * apparent latencies.
 * 
 * If `use_physical_time` is `false`, then this reactor
 * extracts the publisher's timestamp from the message and adds the
 * specified offset to get the desired output timestamp. If there
 * is no timestamp on the incoming message, then this prints a
 * warning and uses physical time. If the received timestamp equals
 * current logical time, then a microstep is added. If the desired
 * output timestamp is in the past, then a warning will be printed and
 * the tag of the message will be one microstep later than
 * the current tag when it arrives.
 * 
 * Note that if the publisher and subscriber are both Lingua Franca
 * programs, then the communication behaves a physical connection
 * if `use_physical_time` is true (the default). The offset is
 * equivalent to an `after` delay.
 * 
 * If `use_physical_time` is false, then the communication attempts
 * to behave like a logical connection, but this is not always possible.
 * Logical time can advance between when the publisher launches a message,
 * sending it to the MQTT broker, and when the subscriber receives it.
 * This may make it impossible to match the desired timestamp and will
 * result in warning messages being printed.
 * 
 * @param address The IP address of the MQTT broker.
 * @param topic The topic name to which to subscribe.
 * @param use_physical_time If true, then use physical time (the default).
 * @param offset The offset to add to the publisher's timestamp.
 * @see MQTTPublisher.
