/**
 * This is a first experiment with using ChatGPT to generate reaction code.
 * The prompt given to ChatGPT has three parts:
 * 
 * 1. A generic part that is the same for all uses.
 * 2. A reaction-specific part that can be automatically generated.
 * 3. A user-written part that describes what the reaction should do.
 * 
 * Concatenate these three parts and submit it to ChatGPT.  A typical response
 * ignores the first paragraph instructions and generates something with the
 * following structure:
 * 
 * ```
 * #include <stuff>
 * define functions and maybe structs
 * 
 * void yourCode() {
 *   reaction body
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * The stuff within the yourCode() function can often be just pasted into the reaction
 * body. Sometimes it needs small corrections.
 * 
 * The stuff outside the yourCode() function should be put into a preamble.
 * An example is given here with verbatim output from ChatGPT.
 * 
 * This work is inspired by the following paper, which shows how effective the
 * three-part prompt approach can be:

 *     "ChatGPT in the Loop: A Natural Language Extension for Domain-Specific
 *     Modeling Languages," AISoLA, Crete, Greece, Oct. 23-28, 2023.

/* Generic prompt (omitting state variables, lf_request_stop(), and some other stuff):

Start a new conversation.

Please generate a code fragment. Generate code only, with comments if
appropriate, but no additional text. Your code should be a fragment to be later
inserted into a procedure. There should be no main function and no surrounding
function definition.

Your code will execute at a logical time that is returned by the function
lf_time_logical, which takes no arguments. It will execute at a physical time
that is returned by the function lf_time_physical, which also takes no
arguments. Both functions return a positive value of type interval_t, which is
an alias for a long long that represents time in nanoseconds (Unix Epoch time).

The code may read inputs from input ports. Each port has a type.
The environment around your code will provide a pointer that you can use to
refer the port. The pointer points to a C struct that has a value field whose
type matches that of the port.  The struct also has an is_present
field that is true if the input is present at the current logical time.
If the port type is an array (for example, int[]), then the length of
the array is available in a field called length.

The code may produce scalar outputs by calling the function lf_set, which takes two
arguments: the output port on which to produce the output and the value to be
produced.  The environment around your code will provide a variable that
refers to the output port.

If the output port has an array type, such as int[], then you can produce an array output
using the function lf_set_array, which takes three
arguments: the output port variable, the array (which must be dynamically allocated
using malloc or calloc), and the length of the array.  Your code should not free
the memory you have dynamically allocated.
