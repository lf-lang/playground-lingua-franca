/**
 * This version of NRP_FD simply has the primary (node1) failing after 5 seconds and the backup
 * (node2) failing at at 15s. The backup detects simultaneous loss of the heartbeat on both networks
 * and hence assumes that the primary has failed rather than there being a network failure. Switch 1
 * remains the NRP.
