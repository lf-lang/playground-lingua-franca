/**
 * A web socket server enabling a user interface realized in the browser. This creates a web server
 * that listens on a port (default 8080) for web socket connections. The intended usage is that you
 * create a client in an HTML/JavaScript file that connects to this server and provides a
 * browser-based user interface.
 *
 * This version is simpler to use than WebSocketServer. It is limited to a single connection at a
 * time and to string-valued messages.
 *
 * If an `initial_file` parameter value is provided, it is expected to be a path relative to your
 * source `.lf` file. This can be used to provide the initial HTML (with embedded JavaScript) that
 * will then establish a web socket connection to the running LF program.
 *
 * When a connection is established with a client, an output with value `true` is produced on the
 * `connected` port. A value `false` is produced when the client disconnects.
 *
 * To send messages to a client, simply provide a string on one of the `in_dynamic` or `in_static`
 * input ports. The former is used for dynamically-allocated strings (type `char*`) and the latter
 * for statically allocated strings (type `string`). If both are provided at the same tag, then only
 * the `in_dynamic` message will be sent.
 *
 * When a message is received from a client, a string will be produced on the `received` output
 * port. The type of this port is `char*`, indicating a dynamically-allocated string.
 *
 * This uses the <a href="https://libwebsockets.org">libwebsockets</a> (see <a
 * href="https://libwebsockets.org/lws-api-doc-main/html/index.html">API documentation</a> and <a
 * href="https://libwebsockets.org/lws-api-doc-main/html/md_READMEs_README_build.html">installation
 * instructions</a>). To install on MacOS, we recommending using brew:
 * <pre> brew install libwebsockets
 * </pre> This puts the compiled libraries in {@code /usr/local/lib}, and these libraries can be
 * linked to providing the {@code -lwebsockets} compile option.
 *
 * A key limitation is that this should use the secure sockets API in libwebsockets to get SSL.
 *
 * @param hostport The host port number, which defaults to 8080.
