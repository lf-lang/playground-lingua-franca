/**
 * This project implements a fault-tolerant task execution model using checkpoint and retry
 * mechanisms, and predictive task dropping. The system is designed to simulate execution of
 * multi-segment tasks with faults using logical execution time.
 *
 * 1. Checkpointed Task Execution: Tasks are divided into segments, each with its own worst-case and
 * optimistic execution time. Faults are simulated with probabilistic failures, and task is restored
 * from the checkpoint when fails.
 *
 * 2. Predictive Task Dropping: Upon segment failure, the system evaluates whether retrying will
 * still meet the task's deadline and only proceeds if the deadline constraint is preserved.
 *
 * The purpose of this design is to investigate how logic-based scheduling and retry policies can
 * improve reliability in real-time embedded systems.
