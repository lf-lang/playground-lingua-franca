#include <led_remapping.h>

/*
    Remaps the single-dimension LEDs array to a 2D remapped array.
    Provides an abstraction allowing the programmer to use a 2-dimensional mapping for simplicity.
    It counts the current LED using the counter. If the row is even, it maps the row and column to that LED directly.
    If the row is odd, it maps the LEDs backward for that row.
    This accounts for the LED board's serpentine pattern, whereby alternating rows are connected left-to-right, then right-to-left. 

    returns: A dynamically allocated 2D array of CRGB pointers (CRGB**)
