/**
 * This program models two aircraft moving in a two-dimensional space for testing an Airborne
 * Collision Avoidance System (ACAS). In this example, both aircraft are equipped with the same ACAS
 * system.
 *
 * It is based on the following paper:
 *
 * Arthur Clavière, Laura Altieri Sambartolomé, Eric Asselin, Christophe Garion, ans Claire Pagetti,
 * "Verification of machine learning based cyber-physical systems: a comparative study,"
 * International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC), May 2022, Pages 1–16,
 * https://doi.org/10.1145/3501710.3519540
 *
 * The original Python code on which this is based was provided by Arthur Clavière.
 *
 * The ML models (in code/src/systems/acasxu/nnets) come from
